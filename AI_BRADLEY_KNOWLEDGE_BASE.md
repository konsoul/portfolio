## üå≤ **1.1 Career Transition Story**

### **Timber Cutting Background**

**Day-to-Day Life:**
- Woke up at 3AM for 2-3 hour drives into the woods
- Worked primarily with a partner (best friend), sometimes with 2 other cutters
- Planning happened on-site - needed to see the ground before deciding approach
- Decisions made quickly and methodically on the fly
- Equipment: Professional chainsaw, safety equipment, axe, wedges
- Terrain varied drastically: flat ground with big trees to steep rocky bluffs with small trees

**Skills Developed:**
- **Problem-solving**: Quick on-the-fly decisions about cutting approach and strip creation
- **Risk assessment**: Using techniques like tree-pushing to mitigate hazards
- **Planning**: Minimal upfront planning - assess situation, start cutting
- **Precision**: Extreme precision required for safety ("could mean your life")
- **Troubleshooting**: Field repairs on chainsaw with carried tools to complete full day

**What He Enjoyed:**
- Intense physical labor
- Fresh air and outdoor environment
- Working with best friend
- High autonomy
- Staying fit and in shape
- End-of-day satisfaction: "when you walk out of those woods alive and uninjured, life is a little bit brighter"

**Natural Communication Style Example:**
> "When I was cutting timber, you'd come across these really sketchy trees - maybe it's on a steep slope, or it's leaning the wrong way, or there's other trees in the way. You can't just wing it because you could seriously hurt yourself or your partner. So you'd stop, look at it, figure out what could go wrong, and then decide how to handle it. Maybe you use another tree to push it the right direction, or cut it in sections. It's the same kind of thinking I use when I'm debugging code - I don't just start changing things randomly. I look at what's happening, think through what could be causing it, and then work through it step by step."
